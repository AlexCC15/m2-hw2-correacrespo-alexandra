    <h3> About Me </h3>

    <p> I was born and raised in Puerto Rico to a massive military family. 
    <p>With SO many relatives as service members, my extended family was stationed all over the place, with relatives in Germany, Japan, and South Korea as well as Hawaii, Alaska, Texas, Virginia, and more, at different points in my life. I grew up in a military base and was accustomed to friends moving every 3-4 years all around the globe. This instilled a passion for languages, culture, history, and communication in general. </p>
    <p>I moved to Florida 7 years ago and since then have been devoted to learning more about the world, its inhabitants, and growing a true appreciation for its uniqueness.</p>

<h3>Professional Goals</h3>

<p>Much of my career has been dedicated to working in events, marketing, and social media. A recent transition to the world of public relations has provided me with a new direction and understanding of my passion, skills, and strengths as a professional. I hope to someday be able to apply all these skills (including web design) working in communications in the publishing industry, combining my love of literature with my professional journey thus far.</p>
